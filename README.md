TODO checklist
1. Keyword fetching from python script
2. Response UI to be worked upon
3. Integrate React with the spring application to work as a single standalone application
4. Create a save data on exit (on exit close of the event)
5. On exit we restart the application with the help of a .sh file using command (mvn clean install && mvn spring-boot:run)
6. Important to implement multithreading as high traffic will impact the data.
