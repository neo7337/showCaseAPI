1. Keyword fetching done using Java TextRank - Done

3. Integrate React with the spring application to work as a single standalone application

5. On exit we restart the application with the help of a .sh file using command (mvn clean install && mvn spring-boot:run)
6. Important to implement multithreading as high traffic will impact the data.
